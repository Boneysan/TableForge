# Performance Targets Validation Summary

## 🎯 TableForge Phase 3 Performance Targets

Based on the Phase 3 implementation, these are the specific performance targets we've built the system to achieve:

### ⚡ Response Time Targets

| Metric | Target | Implementation Strategy |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **API Endpoints** | <50ms (95th percentile) | Redis caching, query optimization, connection pooling |
| **Database Queries** | <25ms (95th percentile) | Optimized indexes, query batching, prepared statements |
| **Cache Operations** | <5ms (95th percentile) | In-memory + Redis multi-layer caching |
| **WebSocket Messages** | <10ms delivery time | Redis pub/sub scaling, message batching |

### 📈 Scalability Targets

| Metric | Target | Implementation Strategy |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **Concurrent Users** | 1000+ per instance | WebSocket scaling with Redis pub/sub |
| **Database Connections** | 20 connections supporting 1000+ users | Optimized connection pooling (50:1 ratio) |
| **Cache Hit Rate** | >90% for frequently accessed data | Smart caching strategy with preloading |
| **Horizontal Scaling** | Support 10+ instances seamlessly | Redis-based instance coordination |

### 💾 Resource Usage Targets

| Metric | Target | Implementation Strategy |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **Memory Usage** | <512MB per 1000 concurrent users | Efficient object pooling, garbage collection optimization |
| **CPU Usage** | <70% under peak load | Asynchronous processing, optimized algorithms |
| **Database CPU** | <50% under normal load | Query optimization, proper indexing |
| **Network Bandwidth** | Optimized WebSocket messages | Message compression, batching strategies |
