## ⚡ Phase 3 Multi-Level Caching Architecture

### 🏗️ Advanced Performance Infrastructure
TableForge implements a sophisticated **3-tier caching system** designed for enterprise-scale performance:

### Cache Architecture Overview
- **L1 (Application Cache)**: In-memory cache using JavaScript Map with TTL support and LRU eviction
- **L2 (Distributed Cache)**: Redis-based shared cache for multi-instance deployments with persistence
- **L3 (Edge Cache)**: CDN/Edge cache for static assets and public game configurations with global distribution

### 🔄 Intelligent Cache Strategy
- **Cascading Fallback**: L1 → L2 → L3 → Data Loader pattern with automatic population
- **Smart Invalidation**: Pattern-based invalidation across all cache levels (`user:*`, `room:*`)
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in hit rate tracking and cache level statistics
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with domain-specific cache interfaces

### Cache Implementation Features
```typescript
// Multi-level cache usage examples
import { createMultiLevelCache } from '@server/cache';

const cache = createMultiLevelCache();

// Cache-or-load pattern with automatic L1/L2/L3 population
const roomState = await cache.getOrSet(
  'room-abc', 
  'room-state',
  () => database.getRoomState('room-abc'),
  1800 // 30 minute TTL
);

// Specialized invalidation
await cache.invalidateUserData('user-123');
await cache.invalidateRoomData('room-abc');
```

### 📊 Cache Performance Characteristics
- **Target Hit Rates**: L1 (70-80%), L2 (15-20%), L3 (5-10%), Overall (90-95%)
