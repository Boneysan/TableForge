# High-Impact Build Plan for TableForge VTT (Replit-Optimized)

*A comprehensive roadmap for production-ready virtual tabletop implementation tailored for Replit infrastructure*

## ðŸ”§ Replit Infrastructure Considerations

**Replit Strengths:**
- Node.js 20 + TypeScript native support
- Built-in PostgreSQL database
- Autoscale deployment for horizontal scaling
- WebSocket support with proper port handling
- Integrated secrets management

**Replit Limitations & External Services:**
- Memory: ~4GB limit (upgrade for more)
- Storage: Use external services (GCS, S3)
- Advanced monitoring: External APM required
- Redis: Use Redis Cloud or Upstash
- Multi-region: Single-region deployment

## ðŸš¨ High-Impact Risks & Fixes

### 1) WebSocket Auth & Multiserver Scale (Replit-Adapted)

**Why:** Real-time VTTs hinge on correct room scoping, auth, and broadcast fan-out.

**What to do:**

- **JWT Authentication**: Use JWT or short-lived access tokens during the WS handshake; re-verify on reconnect; enforce room-scoped ACLs server-side.

- **Replit Autoscale**: Leverage Replit's Autoscale deployment for horizontal scaling instead of manual sticky sessions or custom load balancers.

- **External Redis**: Use Redis Cloud or Upstash for pub/sub and session storage (Replit doesn't include Redis).
  ```bash
  # Add to Replit Secrets:
  REDIS_URL=redis://your-redis-cloud-url
  ```

- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limits (messages/sec per client) using in-memory store + Redis backend for distributed rate limiting.

- **Authoritative State**: Introduce server-side authoritative state for sensitive moves (e.g., hidden hands, shuffles) and idempotent operations (server assigns move IDs to prevent duplicates).

### 2) Asset Pipeline & Storage Safety (External Services)

**Why:** GCS buckets + user uploads are a common attack surface and cost hotspot.

**What to do:**

- **External Storage**: Use Google Cloud Storage, AWS S3, or Cloudflare R2 via API (Replit doesn't provide large storage).
  ```bash
  # Add to Replit Secrets:
  GCS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
  GCS_PROJECT_ID=your-project
  GCS_CREDENTIALS=your-service-account-json
  ```

- **Signed URLs**: Switch to signed URLs (time-bound) for downloads and direct-to-cloud uploads (client gets a single-use upload URL). Validate Content-Type, max size, and file signatures server-side before issuing URLs.

- **Media Optimization**: Generate thumbnails/server-side derivatives (webp, capped dimensions) to cut bandwidth. Use Replit's compute for image processing.

- **Quotas & Lifecycle**: Enforce per-room/per-user quotas, lifecycle rules (auto-expire temp assets), and virus scanning via external service (ClamAV API or SaaS).

### 3) Data Model Constraints & Integrity (Replit PostgreSQL)

**Why:** Board state drifts and race conditions are the silent killers of VTTs.

**What to do:**

- **Database Constraints**: Use Replit's built-in PostgreSQL or external Neon/Supabase. Add NOT NULL, CHECK, UNIQUE constraints; ON DELETE rules that match gameplay semantics; partial indexes for hot queries.
  ```bash
  # Recommended external PostgreSQL for production:
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your-neon-db-url
  # Or use Replit's built-in PostgreSQL for development
  ```

- **Event Sourcing**: For turn/room events, persist append-only event logs (immutable) + projected state tables for fast reads; this helps debugging desyncs.

- **Concurrency Control**: Use advisory locks (pg_advisory_xact_lock) or optimistic concurrency (row version) for atomic shuffles/deals.

### 4) Server Performance Guardrails (Replit Limits)

**Why:** Real-time + assets can melt a single box quickly, especially with Replit's resource constraints.

**What to do:**

- **Backpressure**: Add p-limit style backpressure on expensive endpoints; queue/merge bursty operations (e.g., batch position updates at 30â€“60 Hz).

- **External Caching**: Cache room snapshots in Redis Cloud/Upstash; invalidate on writes; support delta updates to clients.
  ```typescript
  // Use external Redis for caching in Replit
  const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);
  ```

- **Memory Management**: Monitor Replit's ~4GB memory limit; implement garbage collection hints and connection pooling.

- **Observability**: Expose /metrics (Prometheus), count WS connections/room, broadcast size, cache hit rate, query p95/p99. Use Replit's built-in monitoring + external APM (DataDog, New Relic).

### 5) Security Posture

**Why:** You'll host user-generated content and private game rooms.

**What to do:**

- **Headers & CSP**: Enforce CSP (default-src 'self'; images media from bucket domains; block inline scripts), Helmet headers, SameSite=strict cookies for sessions.

- **Input Validation**: Input validation with Zod on every API/WS message; reject unknown keys; cap array lengths and string sizes.

- **Audit Logging**: Audit logs: who did what in which room (minimal PII), rotated and redactable.

- **Secrets Management**: Secrets: prefer workload identity/OIDC on cloud; avoid long-lived JSON creds in .env.

- **RBAC**: Admin/GM/Player RBAC: centralize in middleware; add unit tests for permission matrices.

### 6) Testing Depth & Determinism

**Why:** A VTT has lots of UI + WS edge cases.

**What to do:**

- **Property-Based Testing**: Property-based tests for deck operations (shuffle/deal/merge) ensuring invariants (no duplicates, all cards accounted).

- **Load Testing**: Soak tests for 20â€“100 clients joining/leaving/broadcasting; assert no memory leaks and steady p95 latency.

- **Flake Control**: E2E flake control: freeze time (fake timers), seed RNG for deterministic shuffles in tests, mock storage.

- **Contract Testing**: Contract tests between shared/ schemas and server routes to guarantee API stability.

### 7) Frontend Performance & UX Resilience

**Why:** Tables with thousands of tokens/annotations can jank.

**What to do:**

- **Virtualization**: Window/virtualize heavy lists and canvas layers; consolidate state updates with requestAnimationFrame.

- **Caching Strategy**: Use React Query cache TTLs per resource (rooms short, systems long).

- **Offline Resilience**: Offline-tolerant command queue (optimistic UI) with server reconciliation and "last writer wins" or vector clocks for drawing/annotations.

### 8) Observability You Can Act On (Hybrid Approach)

**Why:** You can't fix what you can't see, but Replit has monitoring limitations.

**What to do:**

- **Basic Metrics**: Use Replit's built-in monitoring + custom Prometheus endpoint for development.
  ```typescript
  // /metrics endpoint for Replit monitoring
  app.get('/metrics', (req, res) => {
    // Basic metrics compatible with Replit
  });
  ```

- **External APM**: For production, use DataDog, New Relic, or Sentry for advanced tracing and alerting.
  ```bash
  # Add to Replit Secrets:
  DATADOG_API_KEY=your-datadog-key
  NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=your-newrelic-key
  ```

- **Structured Logging**: Structured logs (pino) with request/room IDs; sample chatty logs. Use LogTail or similar for log aggregation.

- **Alerting**: Alert on: WS error rate, broadcast lag, memory usage (Replit limits), Redis evictions, 429/5xx spikes.

### 9) Deployment Hardening (Replit-Native)

**Why:** Local dev is fine; prod needs guardrails, and Replit has specific deployment patterns.

**What to do:**

- **Replit Configuration**: Optimize `.replit` file for production deployment.
  ```toml
  # .replit optimized for TableForge
  modules = ["nodejs-20", "web", "postgresql-16"]
  run = "npm run dev"
  
  [deployment]
  deploymentTarget = "autoscale"  # Handles horizontal scaling
  build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
  run = ["npm", "run", "start"]
  
  [env]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  PORT = "5000"
  MEMORY_LIMIT = "4096"  # Max for Replit Core
  ```

- **Health Checks**: Implement robust health checks for Replit's autoscaler.
  ```typescript
  // Health check endpoint for Replit
  app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
    // Check DB, Redis, and memory usage
  });
  ```

- **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor Replit's memory/CPU limits; implement graceful degradation when approaching limits.

- **Secrets Management**: Use Replit Secrets for all sensitive configuration instead of .env files.

### 10) Product Fit for VTTs

**Why:** Polishing the "table feel" matters.

**What to do:**

- **Authoritative Randomness**: Authoritative shuffles with server-seeded randomness; client can request seed for reproducible replays.

- **History & Undo**: Replay/undo: bounded event history with checkpoint snapshots.

- **System Evolution**: Template versioning for systems; migration helpers when schemas change.

- **Accessibility**: Accessibility: keyboard shortcuts for core actions; focus management with Radix + ARIA.
